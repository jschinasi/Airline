# Southwest Check-In Script
## Ready-to-Run

Prepare your scripts that are ready to run locally here. On your computer, copy the `checkin.py` template file here and modify it accordingly with your flight information. Remember to run the script over 24 hours before your flight and leave your computer on and connected to the Internet!

*Note: Any Python files in here will not be committed to the repository!*

### Debugging
Since Python files will not be committed to the repository, that also means that they won't be updated whenever you `git pull`. As such, if the script is not working, make sure to delete the old `checkin.py` files here, `git pull` to get the newest code, and then copy the updated `checkin.py` back into this folder. Then try to run it again!
